No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?\"<br \/>\r\nSection 1.10.33 of \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\", written by Cicero in 45 BC<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"At vero eos et accusamus et iusto odio dignissimos ducimus qui blanditiis praesentium voluptatum deleniti atque corrupti quos dolores et quas molestias excepturi sint occaecati cupiditate non provident, similique sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollitia animi, id est laborum et dolorum fuga. Et harum quidem rerum facilis est et expedita distinctio. Nam libero tempore, cum soluta nobis est eligendi optio cumque nihil impedit quo minus id quod maxime placeat facere possimus, omnis voluptas assumenda est, omnis dolor repellendus. Temporibus autem quibusdam et aut officiis debitis aut rerum necessitatibus saepe eveniet ut et voluptates repudiandae sint et molestiae non recusandae. Itaque earum rerum hic tenetur a sapiente delectus, ut aut reiciendis voluptatibus maiores alias consequatur aut perferendis doloribus asperiores repellat.\"\r\n1914 translation by H. Rackham<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains.\"<\/p>","Answer":"N\/A","Shuffle":"bananna","Stimuli Notes":"filler passage"},{"Cue":"<p>GRE scores are a pre requisite for admissions to programs of graduate study offered by colleges in the US, Canada and some other countries. The GRE General test does not assess your knowledge in any particular area of study; rather it is a test of your verbal reasoning, critical thinking, quantitative reasoning and analytical writing skills. For the purpose of testing these skills, the GRE exam format is based on three sections. These are the Verbal Reasoning, Quantitative Reasoning and the Analytical Writing sections.<\/p>\r\n<p>The Verbal Reasoning section of the GRE is a test of your abilities to analyze a given text by deriving information from it. Your skills related to understanding the structure of sentences and analyzing the relationships between the words contained therein are tested by this section of the GRE. This section of the GRE consists of questions based on analogies, antonyms, sentence completions and reading comprehension. You will generally be presented with three or more GRE reading comprehension passages in the Verbal Reasoning section.<\/p>\r\n<p>The GRE reading comprehension questions will test your ability to analyze a given passage. You will have to read the passage carefully to grasp the actual meaning that is intended to be conveyed through the passage. This can be achieved by studying the GRE reading comprehension passage from all perspectives. You will have to identify all ideas that have been presented in the GRE reading comprehension passage either explicitly or implicitly. You should be familiar with the process of segregating the conclusions from the arguments that have been presented in the GRE reading comprehension passage. This would be essential for answering the questions that follow the given passage.<\/p>","Answer":"N\/A","Shuffle":"bananna","Stimuli Notes":"Critical Passage"},{"Cue":"<p><b>It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia<\/b> is an American television sitcom that premiered on FX on August 4, 2005. New episodes continue to air on FX, with reruns playing on Comedy Central, general broadcast syndication, and WGN America\u2014the first-ever cable-to-cable syndication deal for a sitcom.[1] The show was created, developed, and produced by Rob McElhenney, Glenn Howerton and Charlie Day, who also star in the show. The series follows the exploits of \"The Gang,\" a group of self-centered friends who run Paddy's Pub, a relatively unsuccessful Irish bar in South Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.<\/p>\r\n<p>The series follows \"The Gang\", a group of five depraved underachievers: twins Dennis Reynolds and Deandra \"Dee\" Reynolds; their friends Charlie Kelly and Ronald \"Mac\" McDonald; and Frank Reynolds, Dennis and Dee's father (although not biologically, it is revealed). They run the dilapidated Paddy's Pub, a bar in South Philadelphia. They are often dishonest, egotistical, selfish, greedy, unethical, lazy, manipulative, deceitful, hypocritical, self-centered, vain, disloyal, unremorseful, overly competitive, immature, vengeful, and arrogant. Episodes usually find them hatching elaborate schemes, conspiring against one another and others for personal gain, vengeance, or simply for the entertainment of watching one another's downfall. They inflict physical and psychological pain. They regularly use blackmail to manipulate one another and others outside of the group.<\/p>\r\n<p>Their unity is not solid; any of them would quickly dump the others for quick profit or personal gain regardless of the consequences. Almost everything they do results in competition among themselves and a considerable amount of the show's dialogue revolves around the characters arguing or yelling over one another. Despite their lack of worldly success, the Gang generally maintain high opinions of themselves and display an often obsessive interest in their own reputations and public images. Despite this high sense of self-worth, the Gang often have little sense of shame when attempting to get what they want and will often engage in activities which others would find humiliating, disgusting, or even preposterous, such as smoking crack cocaine in order to qualify for welfare, seducing a priest, or hiding naked inside a leather couch in order to spy on someone.<\/p>","Answer":"N\/A","Shuffle":"bananna","Stimuli Notes":"great show"}],"Procedure":[0,0,{"Item":"0","Trial Type":"Instruct","Max Time":"User","Text":"<h2>Welcome to the Collector tutorial!<\/h2><p>This condition is designed to help familiarize you with the three primary files that you will be modifying when creating your experiments.<\/p>","Shuffle":"# new fix"},{"Item":"0","Trial Type":"Instruct","Max Time":"User","Text":"The three primary files are: Conditions.txt, a procedure file, and a stimuli file.<br\/><br\/>Each of the above files are comma-separated value (CSV) files.
